## Projects Overview

### 1. Face Attendance System
A face recognition-based attendance system that uses OpenCV and face recognition libraries to automatically identify individuals and log their attendance.

**Technologies Used**:
- Python
- OpenCV
- Face Recognition Library

### 2. Image Resizer
A tool to resize images to specified dimensions or scale. Useful for batch processing and preparing images for web or print.

**Technologies Used**:
- Python
- Pillow (PIL)

[View the code](path/to/Image_Resizer.py)

### 3. PDF Merger
A script that merges multiple PDF files into a single PDF document. Ideal for combining reports, articles, or other documents into one file.

**Technologies Used**:
- Python
- PyPDF2

[View the code](path/to/PDF_Merger.py)

### 4. Robot Speaker
A program that converts text to speech and uses a robot's voice to "speak" the text. Useful for creating interactive applications or voice-based notifications.

**Technologies Used**:
- Python
- pyttsx3 (Text-to-Speech Engine)

[View the code](path/to/Robot_Speaker.py)

### 5. Weather App
A simple weather application that fetches and displays weather information based on user input for location. It uses a weather API to get real-time data.

**Technologies Used**:
- Python
- Requests (for API calls)

## Installation

To run any of the projects locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/PrabinDumre/Mini_Projects.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Mini_Projects
   ```

3. Install the required Python packages for a specific project. Each project may have its own dependencies. You can generally install them using:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   Or, install individual dependencies as needed. For example:
   ```bash
   pip install Pillow PyPDF2 pyttsx3 requests
   ```

## Usage

Each project is organized in its own folder. To run a specific project, navigate to its folder and execute the Python script.

Example:
```bash
cd Face_Attendance_System
python Face_Attendance_system.py
```

Replace `Face_Attendance_System` and `Face_Attendance_system.py` with the appropriate folder and script names for other projects.

## Contributing
